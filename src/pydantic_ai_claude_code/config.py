"""OAuth endpoint and client configuration for Claude Code authentication.

These constants were verified against the Claude Code CLI 2.1.263 binary
(embedded config) and its published client metadata:

- `https://claude.ai/oauth/claude-code-client-metadata` (dynamic client registration)
- Authorization server: `https://claude.com/cai/oauth/authorize`
- Token endpoint: `https://platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`

The shared `9d1c250a...` client id is the public client the official CLI uses,
so our flow presents the same credentials to Anthropic's authorization server.
See `flow.py` for the authorization-code flow, and `provider.py` for the API client.
